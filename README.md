## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to create a relaxed, comfortable view of your favourite Reddit content. The application fetches Reddit data via the Reddit API, and displays the content using a React front-end!


## Primary Technologies
* React - v 17.0.1
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
* Enzyme v 3.11.0
* _The project also uses a range of JS libraries, which I will document in due course!_
